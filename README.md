#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methhods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.
It involves the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. 1940s - 1950s : The term "Software engineering" is coined and the field begins to take shapes.
2. 1970s : Structured Programming, Modular design, and Coding standards became popular.
3. 1990s - 2000s : Agile methodologies like Scrum and Extreme programming (XP) gained popularity.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement : Gathering and documenting users needs and system requirements.
2. Design : Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implentation : Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4.  Testing : Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5.  Deployment : Releasing the software to users or customers.
6.  Maintenance : Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancementsto the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall
Sequential approach with distinct phase(e.g requirements, design, implementation) each phase completes before the next begins.
Agile
Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.

Examples of Scenerios
Waterfall : Developing a payroll processing system with fixed requirements and regulatory compliance.
Agile : Creating a new mobile app with evolving features and customer feedback.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer : Responsible for writing code and implementing Software Solutions.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer : Ensures Software quality by designing and executin test plans.
3. Project Manager : Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.
   

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Importance of IDE:
. Provides a comprehensive development environment for writing, debugging, and testing code.
. Offers features like syntax highlighting, code completion, project navigation and debugging tools.
. Enhances productivity, reduces errors and improves code quality.
Examples: Eclipse, Visual Studio.
Importance of VCS:
. Manages changes to code, documentation and other project assets over time.
. Enables collaboration, tracking and control of changes made by multiple developers.
. Allows for versioning, branching, and merging of code changes.
Examples: Git, Subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Common challeges faced by software engineers.
1. Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
2. Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on scedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
3. Security: Ensuring software security, data protection and compliance with regulation.

Strategies to overcome these challenges
1. Embrace flexibity and adaptability , communicate changes  effectively to stakeholders.
2. Prioritize tasksnand focus on high-impact features, use Agile methodologies.
3. Implement secure coding and practices and guidelines, perform regular security audits and testing.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing: Testing individual components or units of code to ensure they work correctly.
2. Integration Testing: Verifies how differnt units of code work together.
3. System Testing: Test the entire software system to ensure it meets requirements.
4. Acceptance Testing: Confirms the software meets customer requirements.
 
   The importance of Testing in software quality assurance
1. Detecting of defects and issues.
2. Ensuring requirements are met.
3. Improves quality
4. Enhance user experience
   

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering can be define as the process of crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a vague prompt.
1. "Write about a Country".
   Improved prompt version would be...
" Write a brief overview of Nigerian's culture, includes its history, customs and traditions."

The improved prompt is more effective because it provides clear direction and focus making it easier for the respondent to create a relevant and useful response.
